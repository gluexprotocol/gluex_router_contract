# GlueX Router Contracts
Welcome to the **GlueX Router Contract** public repository!  

This repository serves as a **central hub for all versions of the GlueX Router smart contract**; a modular smart contract that facilitates user to perform complex, multi-step interactions atomically. Each version is organized into its own directory, offering clear modularity, versioning, and history tracking for ongoing development and upgrades.
